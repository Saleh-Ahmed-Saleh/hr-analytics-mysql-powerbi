🔎 Summary of Findings

The workforce is slightly male-dominant, with approximately 8.9K male, 8.1K female, and 0.5K non-conforming employees. 

The largest racial group is White employees, followed by individuals identifying with two or more races, Black/African American, and Asian employees. Native Hawaiian and American Indian or Alaska Native groups represent the smallest proportions. 

Most employees fall within the 25–34 and 35–44 age groups, indicating a primarily mid-career workforce. The smallest age groups are 18–24 and 55–64. 

Approximately 75% of employees work at headquarters, while 25% work remotely, reflecting a predominantly centralized workforce. 

The organization has experienced a steady increase in employee count from 2000 to 2020, indicating sustained growth. 

Ohio has the highest employee concentration, making it the primary workforce location. 

The average employee tenure is about 8 years, suggesting moderate long-term retention. 

Gender representation across departments is generally balanced, although male employees slightly outnumber female employees in most areas. 

Auditing shows the highest termination rate, followed by Legal and Training, while other departments have relatively similar but slightly lower turnover levels. 


⚠ Limitations
